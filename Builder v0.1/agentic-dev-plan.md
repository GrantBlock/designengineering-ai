# Agentic Development Plan: Project Iron

Updated 2026-11-13 · Grant Block. **Draft (not yet approved by Grant)** except lines marked `[stated]`. Written for Claude in VS Code: open this file, then paste the starter prompt at the bottom.

Related: `development-path.md` (Build automation section), `AGENTS.md` (roles), `CLAUDE.md` (working rules), `review-queue.md` (RQ21).

## Decided so far

- [stated] 2026-11-12: Feature notes live in `design/specs/`, one file per page, like `P08-3D-Designer-Spec.md`.
- [stated] 2026-11-12: Agent sessions run on a schedule, to stay within usage limits and keep Grant's business hours free.
- [stated] 2026-11-12: Four roles: Planner, Coder, Reviewer, Tester.
- [stated] 2026-11-12: The coder `CLAUDE.md` and the issue template wait until Grant finishes the prototype review.
- [stated] 2026-11-13: The build project is named **Iron** (Grant).
- [stated] 2026-11-13: Agent names: Planner **Irileth**, Coder **Hrongar**, Reviewer **Farengar**, Tester **Lydia** (Grant). Agents sign their issue and pull request comments with their name and role, for example "Hrongar (Coder)".
- [stated] 2026-11-13: Iron's process starts with six steps: 1 Project Setup, 2 Design System, 3 Editor Layout Shell, 4 Sidebar UI, 5 Auth Setup, 6 Database Schema (Grant).
- [stated] 2026-11-13: Iron step 3 (Editor Layout Shell) means the content panels inside the common UI: Projects, Designer, Builder and the rest. Each panel needs a feature spec built from its prototype (Grant).
- [stated] 2026-11-13: Time zone is Central (Grant). Business hours 7am to 6pm are assumed (A).
- [stated] 2026-11-13: Agents keep taking work each night until usage reaches 75%, leaving 25% for Grant's own work (Grant). How usage is measured is a Draft below (Usage limit).
- [stated] 2026-11-13: Role files live in `agents/`, and GitHub labels are the hand-off between agents (Grant).
- [stated] 2026-11-13: Do not draft the feature specs yet; Grant reviews the dev plan first (Grant).
- [stated] 2026-11-09: Claude builds; Grant decides and reviews results, not code. No throwaway work.

## Roles

| Role | Who | Model (A) | Job | Hands off with |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planner: Irileth | Grant, with planning chats | Claude Opus 5.5 | Turns each feature note into GitHub issues with acceptance criteria; answers questions; merges | Label `ready-for-tests` |
| Tester: Lydia | Scheduled cloud session | Claude Sonnet 5.5 | Writes acceptance tests from the spec before any code (Playwright, replaying the prototype flow); later checks the preview and posts screenshots | Tests merged, label `ready` |
| Coder: Hrongar | Scheduled cloud session | Claude Fable 5.2 (`claude-fable-5-2`), high effort | Builds the next `ready` issue on its own branch until the tests pass; one pull request into `development` | Label `needs-review` |
| Reviewer: Farengar | Scheduled cloud session | Claude Opus 5.5 | Checks the pull request against the spec, `design/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` and the plan's rules (pricing, levels, numbers, source-of-truth order) | Label `review-passed` or `changes-requested` |

Why tests first: the coder cannot weaken them. The acceptance-test folder needs Grant's approval for any change (CODEOWNERS plus branch protection).

Why a different reviewer model: a second model catches different mistakes, and Opus 5.5 costs half of Fable 5.2 ($4 / $20 against $8 / $40 per million input / output tokens).

## Agent identities

Draft (not yet approved by Grant), 2026-11-13. Each identity becomes the top of its role file in `agents/` (`agents/<name>.md`). The scheduled task's prompt only points to that file.

### Irileth, Planner (`planner`)

- **Goal:** Every feature Grant wants is a clear, testable GitHub issue, in the order Block Concepts needs it, before any agent works on it.
- **Reason:** Grant decides what gets built; agents build only what is written down. Clear issues keep the other agents from guessing, and keep the plan, the prototype and the code in step.
- **Action:**
  1. Grant runs this role himself; Irileth is the planning chat (Opus 5.5) that helps him, in VS Code, the Claude app or Claude Code, during business hours.
  2. Read a feature note in `design/specs/` and its prototype page in `design/exports/`.
  3. Split it into issues that each fit one pull request: what to build, acceptance criteria, out of scope, prototype page, spec link.
  4. Check each issue against the App Plan, the memory logs and the platform matrix; flag any conflict to Grant instead of choosing.
  5. Label approved issues `ready-for-tests` and set their order.
  6. Answer `blocked` notes, close finished issues, and merge pull requests labeled `review-passed` after Grant tries the preview.
- **Never:** builds code; changes pricing, levels or numbers without Grant; marks an issue ready without Grant's yes.

### Lydia, Tester (`tester`)

- **Goal:** Every issue has acceptance tests that prove it works the way the prototype shows, written before any code; every pull request is checked on its preview.
- **Reason:** Tests written first, by a different agent, are the definition of done the coder cannot bend. Preview checks catch what passing tests miss, such as layout on a phone.
- **Action:**
  1. Runs at 6pm (writing) and 5am (checking), Sonnet 5.5.
  2. 6pm: for each `ready-for-tests` issue, read the issue, the spec and the prototype page, and write Playwright acceptance tests that replay the prototype flow on desktop and phone. Open a pull request with only the tests; when Grant merges it, label the issue `ready`.
  3. 5am: for each open pull request, run the tests against its preview URL, take desktop and phone screenshots, and post the results and screenshots on the pull request.
  4. Then write the morning report: ready to merge, blocked, changes requested, and the night's usage. Send it the way Grant chooses (open question 3).
- **Never:** writes app code; changes a test to make code pass; deletes or skips a failing test.

### Hrongar, Coder (`coder`)

- **Goal:** Turn one `ready` issue at a time into working code that passes its acceptance tests and CI, in one pull request into `development`.
- **Reason:** Fable 5.2 is the most capable model for long build tasks. One issue per branch keeps every change small enough for Grant to try on a preview and merge with confidence.
- **Action:**
  1. Runs at 8pm (build) and 3am (fixes), Fable 5.2 at high effort.
  2. 8pm: take the highest-ordered `ready` issue, label it `in-progress`, branch `coder/<issue number>-<short name>` from `development`.
  3. Build it to the spec and the design system, with unit tests, until the acceptance tests and CI pass.
  4. Open a pull request into `development` that links the issue and says what changed and how to try it; label `needs-review`. Take the next issue, until the night's usage reaches 75% (see Usage limit).
  5. 3am: for each `changes-requested` pull request, fix every review comment on the same branch and label it `needs-review` again.
  6. Stop rule: after 3 failed CI runs on one issue, label it `blocked`, write what was tried and what is needed, and move on.
- **Never:** merges; pushes to `development` or `main`; edits acceptance tests; adds a service, key or paid plan; changes a decision.

### Farengar, Reviewer (`reviewer`)

- **Goal:** No pull request reaches Grant unless it matches its spec, the design system and the plan's rules, with no bugs a careful reviewer would catch.
- **Reason:** A second model catches different mistakes from the coder, and Opus 5.5 costs half as much as Fable 5.2. Grant reviews results, not code, so this role is his code review.
- **Action:**
  1. Runs at 1am, Opus 5.5.
  2. For each `needs-review` pull request, read the issue, the spec, the diff and the CI results.
  3. Check: does it do what the issue says and nothing more; does it follow `design/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`; does it respect the plan (pricing, levels, numbers, data rules, abuse and loss controls in App Plan 6.4); are there bugs, security problems or secrets; are the tests real.
  4. Post review comments on the lines that need fixing, each with the fix.
  5. Label `review-passed` when nothing is left, or `changes-requested` with a short summary.
- **Never:** pushes code; approves its own suggestions; merges.

## Feature specs (one per content panel)

[stated] 2026-11-13: every content panel needs a feature spec built from its prototype, in `design/specs/`, one file per page, using the layout of `P08-3D-Designer-Spec.md`. Draft (not yet approved by Grant): the list, file names and grouping below. Folded pages (P10, P11, P13, P14) are covered inside the page that holds them.

Spec layout: 1 Purpose · 2 Decisions stated by Grant · 3 Where it appears · 4 Desktop layout · 5 Phone layout · 6 States · 7 Data it reads and writes · 8 Plan rules that apply (levels, extensions, viewers, limits) · 9 Out of scope · 10 Placeholder content in the prototype · 11 Grant's notes · Log.

| Later | Lite (desktop app) | P16 | `P16-Lite-Spec.md` | ☐ |

How a spec gets made: Irileth drafts it from the prototype page and the logs (tracker, memory logs, platform matrix); Grant edits it during the prototype review; when Grant marks it approved, Irileth splits it into issues.

## Hand-off labels (the state machine)

`spec` → `ready-for-tests` → `ready` → `in-progress` → `needs-review` → `changes-requested` or `review-passed` → Grant merges. `blocked` means an agent stopped and left a note.

## Nightly schedule (Central time; business hours 7am to 6pm (A))

| Time | Role | Does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 7am to 6pm | Grant with Irileth | Grant's hours: prototype review, planning chats, merges |
| 6pm | Lydia (Tester) | Writes tests for new `ready-for-tests` issues |
| 8pm | Hrongar (Coder) | Builds `ready` issues one at a time until usage reaches 75% |
| 1am | Farengar (Reviewer) | Reviews every `needs-review` pull request |
| 3am | Hrongar (Coder) | Fixes `changes-requested` pull requests |
| 5am | Lydia (Tester) | Checks preview URLs, posts screenshots and test results |
| 6:30am | Lydia's report | One message: ready to merge, blocked, cost of the night |

## Usage limit (Draft (not yet approved by Grant))

Goal ([stated]): stop each night at 75% of usage, so 25% is left for Grant's business hours.

An agent cannot reliably read the plan's usage meter from inside a session (A, to verify when the environment is set up). How it is enforced:
1. **Calibrate on the dry run:** record what one issue costs for each agent.
2. **Nightly cap:** set the number of issues per night so the total stays under 75%; Lydia's report shows the night's usage so the cap can be raised or lowered.
3. **Hard backstop:** if the agents run on an Anthropic API key, a workspace spend limit in the Console set to 75% of the daily budget; on a subscription plan, agents stop at the first usage warning.
4. Every agent checks before taking new work: if the cap is reached, it stops and notes it in the report.

## Rules for every agent

- Never merge, never push to `development` or `main` directly, never touch `main`.
- One coder at a time, one issue per branch, one pull request per issue.
- Stop rule: after 3 failed CI runs on one issue, label it `blocked`, write what was tried, move on.
- No secrets in the repository. Keys live in Cloudflare secrets, GitHub Actions secrets and the cloud environment's credentials.
- Follow `CLAUDE.md`: propose before changing a decision; never change pricing, levels or numbers; mark assumptions (A).
- Spending caps: a monthly cap for Claude Code usage and a separate hard cap on the app's Anthropic API key.

## Files to add (one approval each)

| Path | What |
| --- | --- |
| `agents/planner.md` | How to turn a feature note into issues; issue format |
| `agents/tester.md` | How to write acceptance tests from a spec; preview checks |
| `agents/coder.md` | Definition of done; branch and pull request rules; stop rule |
| `agents/reviewer.md` | Review checklist (spec, design system, plan rules, tests) |
| `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature.md` | Spec link, acceptance criteria, out of scope, prototype page |
| `.github/CODEOWNERS` | Acceptance tests need Grant's approval |
| Coder `CLAUDE.md` (in the app folder, O1) | After the prototype review |

Each scheduled task's prompt is one line, for example "Read `Builder v0.1/agents/coder.md` and follow it." Changing a role means editing its file in VS Code, not the schedule.

## Setup steps for Grant (in order)

1. [ ] Finish the prototype review; approve one feature spec per content panel in `design/specs/` (see Feature specs).
2. [ ] Answer the build-gating decisions: RQ11 (D3 to D12), RQ15 (O1 app location, O2 styling, O3 package manager), RQ14 (preview access).
3. [ ] Open service accounts in test mode: Cloudflare (Workers paid plan, Access, R2), managed PostgreSQL, Clerk, Stripe, Liveblocks, Trigger.dev, Anthropic API key for the app.
4. [ ] Set spending caps (Claude Code usage; the app's API key).
5. [ ] Approve the cloud environment for this repository (allowed hosts, setup script); proposed from a Claude Code session.
6. [ ] Protect `development` and `main`: passing checks and Grant's approval to merge.
7. [ ] Approve the files above (role files, labels, issue template, CODEOWNERS), then the coder `CLAUDE.md`.
8. [ ] Dry run: one night, Coder only, on Iron step 1 (Project Setup); Grant checks the result in the morning.
9. [ ] Turn on the Tester and Reviewer, then the full schedule and the morning report.

## Iron process (build order, Block Concepts prototype first)

Steps 1 to 6 are Grant's ([stated] 2026-11-13). Each step becomes one or more issues. The scope notes and steps 7 onward are Draft (not yet approved by Grant).

| # | Step | Scope (Draft) | Prototype source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Project Setup | App skeleton on Cloudflare Workers (D1, D2), CI (type-check, lint, unit tests, Workers build, Playwright), preview URL per pull request behind Cloudflare Access, coder `CLAUDE.md` | - |
| 2 | Design System | Tokens, fonts and the components from `design/system-kit/` as code, each matching `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md` | `design/system-kit/` |
| 3 | Editor Layout Shell | The content panels inside the common UI ([stated] 2026-11-13): Projects, Designer, Builder, Vault, Dashboard and the other pages. Each panel is built from its feature spec (below), one or more issues per panel | Each page's prototype in `design/exports/` |
| 4 | Sidebar UI | The common UI around the panels: sidebar with Chat and Projects modes, navigation rows (extensions hidden until bought), Recents, account footer, top bar, session panel, Search overlay, phone tab bar | `exports/shared/shell.js`, `shell.css`, P01 |
| 5 | Auth Setup | Sign in, create account, verification code, forgot password (D4, Clerk preferred) | P04 |
| 6 | Database Schema | Organization, User, Project (Job or Resource), Process, Document, Model, Schedule and Task, Note and Update, Calculator, Chat, Plan, Vendor Request, Customer Quote, Wallet transaction, Extension, Builder package (App Plan 4.2; D3) | App Plan 4.2 |
| 7 | Draft: chat through the AI adapter (D7) | | P01 to P03 |
| 8 | Draft: Vault and uploads (R2) | | P07, P09 |
| 9 | Draft: project workspace (Specifications, Layout, Schedule, Exports) | | P05, P05A, P06, P12 |
| 10 | Draft: Dashboard and updates | | P19 |
| 11 | Draft: Settings, wallet and Stripe | | P15 |
| 12 | Draft: Builder, then Lite (D11, D12), then Design | | P17, P16, P08 |

Gates: step 5 needs D4; step 6 needs D3; step 1 needs O1 to O3 and RQ14.

## Open questions for Grant

1. Morning report: which option (see Report options)?
2. Confirm business hours 7am to 6pm.
3. Are Claude Code sessions billed to a subscription plan or an Anthropic API key? This decides the usage backstop.

## Report options (Draft (not yet approved by Grant))

| Option | What Grant gets | Good | Weak |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A. Phone notification | A short push message from the Claude app at 6:30am | Seen first thing | Short; no history |
| B. Email | A full summary in the inbox | Easy to read and keep | Another inbox item |
| C. "Nightly report" GitHub issue | One comment per night with links to each pull request and issue | Full history next to the work; links work in VS Code | Must open GitHub |
| D. Report file in the repository (`reports/YYYY-MM-DD.md`) | A file per night | History in VS Code | Adds commits; needs a pull request or its own branch |

Recommendation: **C plus A.** Lydia posts the full report as a comment on the "Nightly report" issue and sends a short phone notification with the counts (ready to merge, blocked, usage) and the link.

## Starter prompt for Claude in VS Code

Paste this into the Claude panel in VS Code with the repository open:

```
Read Builder v0.1/CLAUDE.md, then Builder v0.1/agentic-dev-plan.md and Builder v0.1/development-path.md.
I am the Planner. Help me work through the "Setup steps for Grant" in agentic-dev-plan.md, one at a time, starting with the first unchecked step.
For each step: tell me what I do and what you will draft, propose before editing, and end with the questions you need from me.
Do not create the role files, labels or scheduled tasks until I approve them. Log each approval as a dated [stated] line in this file.
```
